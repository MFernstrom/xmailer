X-Mailer plugin
===============

This plugin offers a really simple way to send e-mails using Free Pascal.
For those who like the procedural style, X-Mailer has the SendMail procedure. With one single line, you can configure SMTP settings and fill all the required fields as: From, To, CC, Subject and Message.
For those who prefer an Object Oriented style, X-Mailer has the TSendMail class with the same above mentioned characteristics.

Steps to run the demos with SSL support
=======================================

In Windows, copy the DLLs "libeay32.dll" and "ssleay32.dll" from "xmailer\3rdparty\openssl\win32" to this folder, and try run the demo again.

In Linux, install the libs of OpenSSL(*) projetct, and try run the demo again.

You may need to install libssl-dev for Linux support as well.

(*)
  OpenSSL in openSUSE:
    # zypper in libopenssl-devel 

  OpenSSL in Mint:
    $ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev

  OpenSSL in Fedora:
    $ su
    # cd /usr/lib
    # ln -s libcrypto.so.1.0.0 libcrypto.so
    # ln -s libssl.so.1.0.0 libssl.so

Enjoy!

Xmailer was created by Silvio Clecio (silvioprog), he's deleting it from his repos, so I made a copy.
